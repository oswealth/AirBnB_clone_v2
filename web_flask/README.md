* What is a Web Framework?
A web framework is a software framework designed to support the development of web applications, web services, and web resources.
It provides a standard way to build and deploy web applications on the World Wide Web.

* Example 1: Imagine building a house. Instead of creating every piece from scratch, you use pre-made components like windows and doors.
Similarly, a web framework provides pre-made components for building web applications, like user authentication or database management.

* Example 2: Consider a car assembly line. Each part of the car doesn’t need to be designed individually; there’s a system in place to streamline the process.
A web framework is like that assembly line, streamlining the process of web development.
